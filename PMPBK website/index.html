                    <p>Lent is a period of reflection and repentance in the Christian Church
                        leading up to easter. In the western churches, it starts on ash Wednesday
                        and lasts mass 40 days, excluding sundays, as a way to imitate Jesus's
                        fasting in the wilderness before starting his public ministry. In eastern
                        churches, lent starts on the monday of the 7th week before easter and ends
                        on the friday 9 days before easter, and it's called "Great Lent" that
                        includes saturdays and sundays as less strict fasting days.

                    <p>According to Thomas Aquinas, charity is one of the seven
                        virtues in Christian theology. He views it as the act of
                        loving and connecting with God, and believes it is the
                        most important virtue. Additionally, Aquinas believe that
                        charity should also extend to loving one's neighbor.
